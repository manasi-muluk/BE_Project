README.mdDevelop a platform that reviews existing codebases, identifies untested areas, and suggests or generates optimized test cases to ensure 100% code coverage and consistently high test quality. Create a system that intelligently identifies potential edge cases in the code and automatically generates test cases for these scenarios to ensure consistent reliability and robustness of the application. Develop a tool that automatically checks for consistency between code changes, test cases, and test results, ensuring that all changes are properly tested and no redundant or outdated test cases are present.
