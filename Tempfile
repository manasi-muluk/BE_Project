Problem Statement (Short):

Manually writing unit tests for large-scale React applications is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to errors, especially as complexity increases. This leads to slower development, poor test coverage, and increased maintenance overhead.

The challenge is to develop a scalable, machine-learning-based solution that automatically generates accurate, maintainable, and comprehensive unit tests for React components. By leveraging services like Amazon SageMaker or Bedrock, this system will ensure efficient test generation, improving code quality and reducing manual effort.
