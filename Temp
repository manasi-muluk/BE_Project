Summary Comments on Managing Risks and Strengthening Controls

Throughout the review period, I have implemented several measures to effectively manage risks and enhance controls within our operations:

1. Security Group Requests: I meticulously raised only the necessary security group requests, ensuring that permissions granted were strictly required for my work. This proactive approach minimizes potential security vulnerabilities and maintains a controlled access environment.


2. Adherence to Bug Resolution SLAs: By resolving minor bugs within 2-3 hours and major bugs within 24 hours, I ensured prompt action on issues, reducing the risk of operational disruptions and maintaining product stability.


3. Comprehensive Unit Test Coverage: Achieving 100% test case coverage for UI components I developed significantly strengthens our quality control measures. This proactive testing helps identify issues early, mitigating risks associated with potential bugs in production.


4. Root Cause Analysis for Problem Records: In addressing Problem Record PRB1000127248, I conducted thorough root cause analyses to identify and resolve issues at their source, preventing recurrence and strengthening our overall problem management processes.


5. Acceptance Suite Implementation: I established an acceptance suite for all user journeys I worked on, ensuring thorough end-to-end testing. This reduces the risk of missing critical issues before deployment, enhancing the reliability of our releases.


6. Continuous Monitoring and Documentation: I regularly updated JIRA with the status of tasks and issues, maintaining transparency and facilitating timely interventions. Additionally, I authored a Confluence page to guide team members in troubleshooting local UI setup errors, reinforcing knowledge sharing and risk management.


7. Training and Compliance: Completing all mandatory training ahead of time demonstrates my commitment to adhering to company policies and standards, which reinforces our compliance controls and risk management framework.



Through these initiatives, I have actively contributed to a culture of risk awareness and control enhancement, ensuring our operations remain reliable and secure.
