Summary Comments on Values and Mindset Demonstrated Through LEAD Behaviors

Throughout this review period, I have embodied the LEAD behaviors that reflect our core values, contributing to a positive and productive team environment:

1. Listen: I actively listened to my colleagues during team discussions and Knowledge Transfer (KT) sessions, ensuring that everyoneâ€™s insights and concerns were acknowledged. I also valued the feedback from my line manager during our 1:1 meetings, using it as a basis for personal and professional growth.


2. Engage: I engaged with team members by facilitating knowledge sharing through detailed Confluence documentation and conducting training sessions. By creating resources that assist new joiners and promote best practices, I helped strengthen our collective knowledge base and encouraged a collaborative atmosphere.


3. Adapt: I demonstrated adaptability by embracing new challenges, such as delving into the EPS backend to understand data exchange formats and contributing to both UI and backend development. This flexibility allowed me to better support team objectives and navigate evolving project requirements.


4. Deliver: My focus on timely and high-quality outcomes was evident in my commitment to achieving 100% test coverage and adhering to bug resolution SLAs. By consistently delivering results that meet or exceed expectations, I contributed to the overall success of our projects.


5. Champion Diversity of Thought: I participated in the Big Tech Challenge, which allowed me to learn from diverse perspectives within the tech community. This experience reinforced my belief in the value of different viewpoints and innovative solutions.


6. Proactive Problem-Solving: I actively sought help from senior developers and Tech Leads when faced with challenges that could not be resolved quickly, demonstrating a mindset of collaboration and continuous improvement to ensure project progress.


7. Commitment to Continuous Learning: By completing courses in React and Java 17, I embraced the value of continuous learning, enhancing my skills to better serve my team and contribute to our goals.


8. Responsive to Feedback: I have taken the comments and suggestions from my line manager during our 1:1 meetings to heart, actively working on areas for improvement and integrating that feedback into my daily practices.



Through these actions, I have exemplified the LEAD behaviors, promoting a values-driven culture within our team and aligning with our organizational objectives. I am committed to continuing this mindset as we strive for excellence together.
