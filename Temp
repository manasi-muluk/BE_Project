To ensure precision in operations, risk management, and controls, I have focused on delivering reliable and high-quality outcomes. Below are the key steps I have taken:

1. Security Group Requests: I have been diligent in raising only the necessary security group requests, ensuring that all permissions granted are strictly required for my work.


2. Bug Resolution: I have adhered to the SLA for bug resolution, solving minor bugs within 2 to 3 hours and major bugs within 1 day. This has ensured that any issues are resolved promptly, maintaining the quality and stability of the product.


3. Unit Test Coverage and Code Quality: I ensured 100% test case coverage for the UI components I worked on, with a focus on critical paths to meet the required 90% unit test coverage. Additionally, I followed Sonar code quality guidelines to prevent code smells from increasing with respect to the previous release versions.


4. Acceptance Suite for User Journeys: I have set up the acceptance suite for all the user journeys I worked on, ensuring thorough testing of end-to-end flows and reducing the risk of any missed issues.


5. Accurate Estimation and Timely Delivery: I have consistently provided accurate estimates for the tasks assigned to me, ensuring that I stick to my commitments. My average story completion times are as follows:

1 story point: 2 hours

2 story points: 1 day

3 story points: 1.5 days

5 story points: 2 to 3 days

8 story points: 4 days



6. Mandatory Training: I completed all my mandatory training ahead of time and have not taken any exceptions for working from home, demonstrating my commitment to adhering to company policies and standards.



By maintaining high standards for bug resolution, code quality, and test coverage, I have contributed to ensuring the reliability and precision of our operations, while also actively managing risks and following established controls.
