To provide world-class service and ensure top-quality outcomes, I contributed significantly to the development and delivery of the MCA projects. Here's a breakdown of my contributions:

1. Development of MCA1 and MCA2 UI: I contributed to the development of MCA1 UI (TK001 and Email2) and MCA2 UI (DSF work). My focus was on ensuring seamless functionality and user experience, aligned with the goal of delivering top-notch products for our clients and stakeholders.


2. UI and EPS Deployments: I gained hands-on experience deploying both UI and EPS builds, successfully deploying over 20 UI builds and 4 EPS builds. This has helped ensure smooth and consistent application delivery on Openshift/AWS.


3. Backend (EPS) Knowledge: As part of my learning, I delved into the EPS backend to understand the data exchange format between UI and EPS, enabling me to contribute more effectively to full-stack development and problem-solving.


4. Problem Record Handling (PRB1000127248): I actively worked on resolving this problem record, conducting thorough Root Cause Analysis to address the issue at its source and prevent future occurrences.


5. Story Point Estimation and Subtask Creation: Through collaborative discussions and analysis of previous stories, I improved the accuracy of story point estimation, which has enhanced planning and resource allocation for upcoming features. I also created sub-tasks for every assigned story and logged my work consistently.


6. JIRA Comments and Issue Resolution: I ensured the timely completion of JIRA stories, updating them with the correct status and comments. I also proactively sought help from senior developers/Tech Leads for issues that could not be resolved within a day, ensuring efficient resolution and project progress.



By focusing on quality, timely delivery, and continuous improvement, I have aligned my contributions with the objective of delivering world-class service and long-term client satisfaction.
